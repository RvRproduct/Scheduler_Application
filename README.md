# Scheduler_Application
_Roberto_Reynoso
# Overview
This Application is Called Scheduler Application
It is based on only for the day, so you have 24 hours
to schedule out how your day will be in total. You can't
go over 24 hours, if you do the process will reset and you
will have to enter the goals/tasks again, so make sure you calculate
your time correctly. Any left over time will be put aside as left over
time.

I actually want to develop a more unique, useful, and applicable scheduler app in the future, so the
purpose of making this application was for me to get a better idea of what I might have to do in the
future.

# Development Environment

I used Python and Visual Studio to create this application.

I used Python, I didn't use any special libraries, I did however implement classes
and made sure the code was easy to look at and easy to understand as possible.

# Future Work

* Getting Better at analyzing how long an idea might take within a deadline.
* Getting better at understanding the library given to me, if I am using one, so I can use it to its maximum capacity.
* Get better at Python, so I can feel as though I can create anything with it.

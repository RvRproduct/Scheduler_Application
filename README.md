# Scheduler_Application
This Application is Called Scheduler Application
It is based on only for the day, so you have 24 hours
to schedule out how your day will be in total. You can't
go over 24 hours, if you do the process will reset and you
will have to enter the goals/tasks again, so make sure you calculate
your time correctly. Any left over time will be put aside as left over
time.
